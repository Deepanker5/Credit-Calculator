This is a project I worked on for a coding course in my university. The Credit_hour_calculator.py file contains the code which I wrote for the task. The task was the following: to create a program that can read a file with the date, starti time, end time and the amount of time spent during the lunch break. And calculate the number of credit hours or debt hours the employee has accumulated based on the user's input of how many hours the employee must work and the given intervals for credit or debt hours to be accumulated. The program can scan files that contains flaws in them, such as not the appropriate inputs, spaces etc.  The Working_hours, Working_hours2 and Working_hours3 files is a flawless file that contain various inputs for the Credit_hour_calculator program to work, and the Working_hours_invalid file contains invalid and empty lines to test whether or not the program can continue working as desired even though the scanned file contains errors.
